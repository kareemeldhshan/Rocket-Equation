# Rocket-Equation
This project analyzes rocket motion with gravity and aerodynamic drag to determine how fuel burn timing affects maximum altitude. Using the rocket equation and numerical simulations in Python, it shows that front-loaded burns reach higher altitudes, combining physics, math, and computation to optimize rocket performance.
